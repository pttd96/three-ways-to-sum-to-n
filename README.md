# Sum to N Approaches

This repository demonstrates three different approaches to calculate the sum of the first _n_ natural numbers, as implemented in the `index.ts` file:

- **Approach A:** Iterative for-loop (O(n))
- **Approach B:** Recursive function (O(n))
- **Approach C:** Mathematical formula (O(1))

Each approach is implemented as a TypeScript function and compared by running them with a sample input.

## How to Run

1. **Initialize the project:**
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```
2. **Install TypeScript and ts-node:**
   ```sh
   npm install -D typescript ts-node
   ```
3. **Create a TypeScript config (Optional):**
   ```sh
   npx tsc --init
   ```
4. **Run the code:**
   ```sh
   npx ts-node index.ts
   ```

This will print the results of all three approaches to the console. Feel free to try out with different values for n in `console.log()`.
